**International Movement for Leisure Activities in Science & Tech (MILSET) Expo Sciences Europe** | _Romania_ | _May 2022 – August 2022_

- Developed and integrated hardware-software system using Arduino UNO, DS18B20 temperature sensors, RTC module, and micro SD Card.
- Conducted rigorous testing and debugging of the system, troubleshooting issues with hardware connections and software functionality.
- Implemented SD card logging for real-time data storage and retrieval and used RTC for timestamping temperature measurements.
- Utilized the integrated system to study the impact of greenhouse layering on internal temperatures and presented results at MILSET Expo Sciences Europe 2022.
