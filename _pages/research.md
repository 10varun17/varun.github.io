## Multi-Agent Robotic Systems

**University of Richmond Robotics Lab** | _May 2025 – June 2025; June 2024 - August 2024_ | _Robotics and Control Research Assistant - Dr. Patrick Martin_

- Engineered multi-agent robotic system using Python & ROS2, implementing decentralized coordination with action servers & clients.
- Developed scalable ROS2 packages with custom messages and launch files to streamline agent deployment and communication.
- Designed an experimental setup for formation control with three real differential-drive robots (TurtleBots) and tested the controllers.
- Reviewed existing safety approaches (Artificial Potential Fields, Reinforcement Learning, Control Barrier Functions) and implemented CBF and Exponential CBF-QP controllers in Python to guarantee forward invariance of the safe set in a single-agent system.

## Computer Vision

**University of Chicago Data Science Institute** | _June 2025 – August 2025_ | _Research Software Engineering Intern - Dr. Pedro Lopes_

- Designed and developed the first interactive application (Flutter-based) with a clinician-friendly UI/UX to assess Progressive
  Supranuclear Palsy by detecting downgaze palsy, reducing manual evaluation time from more than 5 minutes to less than a minute.
- Implemented computer vision pipeline for pupil detection, eye corner detection using Harris corner detection + k-means clustering, and iris top edge detection through intensity analysis in single eye images to fully automate downgaze palsy detection.

## Machine Learning

**University of Richmond Department of Physics** | _January 2025 - May 2025_ | _ML Research Assistant - Dr. Jack Singal_

- Developed data generation pipeline to simulate a harmonic one-dimensional, one-component oscillator both without & with damping and noise.
- Applied physics-informed ML techniques and hyperparameter tuning (network architecture, learning rate, etc) to implement and train Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Neural Networks and computed dynamics using learned Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the system.
