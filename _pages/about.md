I'm a junior at the University of Richmond, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics for the academic year 2025-2026. My interests lie in robotics, control theory, and AI/ML.

## Research Interests

My previous research experience was on multi-agent robotics systems and control barrier functions. I'm particularly interested in:

- Decentralized coordination in multi-robot systems
- Control algorithms for autonomous mobile robots

## Current Work

I'm currently a Research Software Engineering Intern at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute, working in the Human Computer Integration Lab. I'm also continuing my previous research work on robotics.

## Education

- **University of Richmond** (Expected May 2027) - B.S. Computer Science, Minors in Physics & Mathematics
- **University of Edinburgh** (2025-2026) - Visiting Student, Department of Informatics
- **GPA**: 4.0/4.0, Dean's List (4 semesters), Richmond Scholar

I'm currently preparing for PhD applications in robotics and AI/ML.
