I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Richmond, currently studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics. I'm passionate about robotics, control systems, and AI/ML applications.


## Research Interests
My research focuses on multi-agent robotics systems, control theory, and machine learning applications in robotics. I'm particularly interested in:
- Decentralized coordination in multi-robot systems
- Control algorithms for autonomous mobile robots
- Applications of Hamiltonian mechanics in robotics simulation


## Current Work
I'm currently a Research Software Engineering Intern at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute, working in the Human Computer Integration Lab. Previously, I've conducted research on multi-agent robotic systems using ROS2 and developed various robotics projects.


## Education
- **University of Richmond** (Expected May 2027) - B.S. Computer Science, Minors in Physics & Mathematics
- **University of Edinburgh** (2025-2026) - Visiting Student, Department of Informatics
- **GPA**: 4.0/4.0, Dean's List (4 semesters), Richmond Scholar


I'm currently preparing for PhD applications in robotics and AI/ML.
