I'm a junior at the University of Richmond, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics for the academic year 2025-2026. My interests lie in robotics, control theory, and AI/ML.

## Research Interests

My previous research experience was on multi-agent robotics systems and control barrier functions. I'm particularly interested in:

- Decentralized coordination in multi-robot systems
- Control algorithms for autonomous mobile robots

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, Dart
**Robotics & AI/ML**: ROS2, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Gazebo, CasADi
**Scientific Computing**: Mathematica, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Development Tools**: Linux, Git, Android Studio, Flutter, RESTful API design
**Hardware**: Arduino, Proteus, Eagle EDA, Sensor Integration, Circuit Design
